// The purpose of this module is to bring your Sequelize instance (`db`) together
// with your models (which you should define in separate modules in this directory).
// Example:
//
// const Puppy = require('./puppy')
// const Owner = require('./owner')

// After you've required all of your models into this module, you should establish
// associations (https://sequelize-guides.netlify.com/association-types/) between them here as well!
// Example:
//
// Puppy.belongsTo(Owner)

Student.belongsTo(Campus, { as: "Campus" });
Campus.hasMany(Student);

/**
 * We'll export all of our models here, so that any time a module needs a model,
 * we can just require it from 'db/models'
 * for example, we can say: const {User} = require('../db/models')
 * instead of: const User = require('../db/models/user')
 */
